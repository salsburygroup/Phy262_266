## ðŸ“š Course Resources Overview

This repository includes links to essential computational course materials.
Included in the links.md file are:
- **All computational assignment files**
   The first three homework assignments included as well as the first computational labs are applied to problems on these assignments, before moving onto separate computational assignments.
- **Results from Two Years of Generative AI (GAI) Experiments**
  A collection of assignments, reports and summaries from this semester and last year on using Generative AI on a mid-semester assignment.
Included in the notebooks directory are:
- **Dr. Salsburyâ€™s Jupyter Notebooks**  
  The full Jupyter notebooks for the assignments:
>  **Note**: This course assumes no prior exposure to Python or computational tools. The instructional design features extensive scaffoldingâ€”from fully worked examples to gradually open-ended coding challengesâ€”to build student competence and confidence.

## Computational Course Materials: PHY 262 & PHY 266

This repository contains materials for:

- **PHY 262: Mechanics**  
- **PHY 266 (first half): Intermediate Laboratory**

Both courses are offered at **Wake Forest University** and integrate **computation as a central component** of instruction.

---

### Prerequisites

**PHY 262** assumes completion of:

- PHY 113 (General Physics I)
- One of the following:
  - MTH 205 (Differential Equations & Linear Algebra)
  - MTH 251 (Differential Equations)
- With MTH 113 (Calculus III) as a co-requisite or prerequisite

**PHY 266** requires Phy 262 as a co-requisite or prerequisite

### Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- Jupyter Notebooks covering computational labs and examples
- Links to external materials on Google Drive
- Assignments, experiment results, and example code

> ⚠️ **Note**: Some notebooks currently label the **Velocity Verlet** integrator as **Leapfrog**. This naming is being corrected in ongoing revisions.

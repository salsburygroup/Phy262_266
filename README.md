# Phy262_266
This is for course materials for Phy 262: Mechanics and the first half of Phy 266: Intermediate lab at Wake Forest University. These are both courses in which computation has been integrated as key components of the course.
Phy 262 requires introductory mechanics (Phy 113) and MTH 205 (Differential Equations & Linear algebra) or MTH 251 (Differential equations) with a co-requisite or pre-requisite of MTH 113 (Calc III)
This repository is a mixture of Jupyter notebooks and links to google drive entries. Note, in some of the notebooks "leapfrog" is written where it should say "velocity verlet", this is bing fixed.

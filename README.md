## Computational Course Materials: PHY 262 & PHY 266

This repository contains materials for:

- **PHY 262: Mechanics**  
- **PHY 266 (first half): Intermediate Laboratory**

Both courses are offered at **Wake Forest University** and integrate **computation as a central component** of instruction.

---

### Prerequisites

**PHY 262** assumes completion of:

- PHY 113 (General Physics I)
- One of the following:
  - MTH 205 (Differential Equations & Linear Algebra)
  - MTH 251 (Differential Equations)
- With MTH 113 (Calculus III) as a co-requisite or prerequisite

**PHY 266** requires Phy 262 as a co-requisite or prerequisite

### Repository Contents

This repository includes:

**PHY 262** 
- Jupyter Notebooks for each lab in the Notebooks directory. These are the keys.
- Links to the course assignments as external materials on Google Drive in links.md

- Link to the GAI assignment, reports and summary in links.md
> ⚠️ **Note**: Some notebooks currently label the **Velocity Verlet** integrator as **Leapfrog**. This naming is being corrected in ongoing revisions.
> 
**PHY 266** 
- Two Jupyter Notebooks for each lab.
- The notebooks labeled "key" are worked out versions. The others are the assignments.
- One could make the assignments easier or harder by reducing on increasing how much is given in the assignments.
- data directory with the data for the notebooks.
- The focus on PHY 266 is on data analysis which they might be able to use in experimental work.
- The PHY 266 re-design was inspired by a Data Science Community of Practice Workshop (https://dsecop.org/).
- The 01 Lab is a lightly edited version of one of their modules. The 02 Lab was inspired by another, but redone for students with less python proficiency.

### Misc Comments

- The audience of Phy 262 is engineering, biophysics, and physics majors. The audience of Phy 266 is biophysics and physics majors.
- To ensure robust and easy access to a standard python environment we used the WFU DEAC HPC https://is.wfu.edu/high-performance-computing/
